    "Hi there, I'm Frank Ivan Kyakusse. A Front-end web developer and the creator of studioFrank I'm thrilled by sleek but wholly inclusive designs. In this era, minimalism is the new complexity. What matters most is that a platform meets all the desired use-cases without excessive UI elements. A single button can unravel different features in various scenarios, leading to a clean and scalable UI. That's what I aim for in my work. Please feel free to navigate through My portfolio, You never know, something might catch your attention.",
